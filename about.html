      <dt><h1>About Me</h1></dt>
      <dd>Originally form the UK, I moved to Medicine Hat in 2019 with my now wife.
        Currently I am studying at Medicine Hat College and working towards an IT Diploma, Majoring in Software.
        I have so far attained a 4.0 GPA in my first semester, and I plan on continuing that trend throughout the rest of
        my time here. <br>
        <br>
        Before becoming a student I worked at a company named Adapt Mobility, where I would regularly adapt solutions for clients
        with accessability needs. From installing grab bars in showers, to creating bespoke solutions for clients. The biggest project I created
        during my time there was to create a database application. I made it to help healthcare professionals narrow down potential wheelchair options 
        for clients. This was mainly to reduce time, paperwork and needless re-scheduling for simple appointments. A healthcare professional could type in 
        measurements from a client into the search function of my database and then narrow down the potential wheelchairs and their potential
         configurations, reducing the amount of calls to our office for questions. <br>
         <br>
         Moving forward, I am setting my sights on a career in Software Development, either working on my practical skills in a company. Or learning
          theoretical skills in further education.
